Tips on how to create awesome command-line tools

## Visual

### Avoid using white on green (and green on white)

Green does not have a great contrast ratio.  
In many terminal themes the contrast is insufficient which results in unreadable text.

For example, check out the color tool for material design: https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&primary.color=64DD17

Example of tool that breaks this tip is `tig`.
